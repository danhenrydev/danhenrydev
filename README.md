## About Me

My name is Dan and I am a comparatively old man in the I.T. space.  I've been working in I.T. for over a decade, and have a newfound passion for Open Source.  I have a passion for Security, and an interest in almost anything technology.

## Current Projects

[K8S-VAGRANT](https://github.com/danhenrydev/k8s-vagrant)<br>
>A configurable, flexible, and consistent local Kubernetes cluster (or clusters) with support for most things that you would expect in a cluster such as LoadBalancer and persistent storage out of the box.

My Homelab<br>
> I maintain a wildly over-engineered homelab where I experiment with things like virtualization, Kubernetes, Security, DevOps, Enterprise Tech, and Open Source, and in general pissing my family off. (You don't make your kids submit tickets!?)

## My Goals

My focus right now and always has been to learn as much as I can about as many things as I can.  Some things that I'm particularly interested in right now are security, DevOps, Kubernetes, Web Development, and Open Source. 

Additionally, I want to make an effort to learn in public.  It seems to come natural to many, and I'm envious of that.  For me though, it brings great anxiety, but I've come to learn the value greatly outweighs the vulnerability.
